# Chatbot
In this project, I compared two different approaches to build a chatbot using seq2seq.  
One is building the embedding matrix from scratch, and one is using GloVe.

Frankly speaking, both of them do not work as well as I expected. This was previously mentioned in this article http://suriyadeepan.github.io/2016-12-31-practical-seq2seq/,
which is mainly due to the training dataset that we used.  

I summarized details of the data processing and modeling part in the slides, while you can also see more detailed statistics of the dataset
when running the code. To start the conversation with the chatbot, you just need simply run the Demo.ipynb or Demo_Glove.ipynb, 
and input your sentenses in the test function.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
